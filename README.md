Solution to a technical test by Kalvad. Co. 

This script is portable and does not require you to edit the file pathname.

The script accepts following paremeters for translation: 
  [‘ces’, ‘deu’, ‘est’, ‘fin’, ‘fra’, ‘hrv’, ‘hun’, ‘ita’, ‘jpn’, ‘kor’, ‘nld’, ‘per’, ‘pol’, ‘por’, ‘rus’, ’slk’, ‘spa’, ‘swe’, ‘urd’, ‘zho’]

To run the script, enter following command in your terminal: "python3 translations.py {parameter}"

Or, for older versions of Python: "python translations.py {parameter}"
